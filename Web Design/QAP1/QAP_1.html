    <h3> <u> In The Beginning...</u> </h3>

    <p> The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the birth of the abacus.
        When the beads on  the  abacus  are  moved  around,  according  to programmingrules  
        memorized  by  the  user,  all  regular arithmetic problems can be done.  In 1671, 
        Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was built  in  1694.  
        It  could  add,  and,  after  changing  some  things  around,  multiply.    
        About  a  century  later Thomas of Colmar  created  the  first  successful mechanical  calculator
        that  could add,  subtract,  multiply, and divide.

    <h3> <u> Other Memprable Events ... </u></h3>

        <li>
            In 1882, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions
            that were constantly repeaded. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine which 
            he called a diffrence engine.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated computing with the development of 
            punched cards. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of punched
            cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. for more than 50 years, punched card
            machines did most of the worlds first business computing.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity. in 1942, John P. Eckert
            and John W. Mauchly decided to build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. known 
            as ENIAC, this  machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field
            - Magnetic core memory and transistor - circuit elements. These technical discoveries quickly
            found their way into computers. Such computer were mostly found in large computer centers operated 
            by industry, government and privite laboratories.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            in the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest posible computer with the greatest capacity 
            reached a turning point with the stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access
            time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable mini computers supplied
            with software packages in the 1970's. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction to 
            personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough 
            to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as Apple Computer and radio shack 
            introduced very successful PC's in the mid 1970's.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            By the late 1980's, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handlig 32 bits 
            of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Computer networking, e-mail and the internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of the
            applications that have grown in recent years. computers continue to decrease in price, offering
            the promise that soon, "computers will reside in most homes, offices and."

    <h3> <u> The Five generations of computers </u> </h3>

    <center>

        <li> <b>  Vaccuum Tubes </b> - Vaccuum tubes allowed the first computers to perform digigtal computations Although tubes made a comeback in high-end stereo components, they have long since been abandoned for TVs and computer monitors. </li>
        <br>
        
        <li> <b> Transistors  </b> - a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them. </li>
        <br>
        
        <li> <b> Integrated Circuits </b> - Commonly called a chip, made out of a semiconductor material called silicon, in which small electronic components called transistors are formed within the silicon and then wired together. </li>
        <br>

        <li> <b> Microprocessors </b> - A microprocessor is a small processing unit inside a CPU. it is a single integrated circuit on a computer chip that performs various arithmetic and logic functions on digital signals.  </li>
        <br>
        
        <li> <b> Artificial Intelligence </b> - Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Examples of A.I are from chess playing computers to self driving cars which rely on deep learning and natural language processing</li>

    <p> For my features I decided to add a background colour for the main header and added bolded text for my "five generations of computers, also i underlined all headings in my article.</p>
