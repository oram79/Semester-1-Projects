        <p> The history of computers starts out about <span style="background-color: violet">2000 years ago</span>, with the birth of the abacus.
            When the beads on  the  abacus  are  moved  around,  according  to programmingrules  
            memorized  by  the  user,  all  regular arithmetic problems can be done.  In 1671, 
            Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was built  in  1694.  
            It  could  add,  and,  after  changing  some  things  around,  multiply.    
            About  a  century  later Thomas of Colmar  created  the  first  successful mechanical  calculator
            that  could add,  subtract,  multiply, and divide.

            <h3> <u> Other Memprable Events ... </u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 1882, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions
                    that were constantly repeaded. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine which 
                    he called a diffrence engine.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith">Herman Hollerith</a> and James Powers made a step towards automated computing with the development of 
                    punched cards. Reading errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of punched
                    cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. for more than 50 years, punched card
                    machines did most of the worlds first business computing.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity. in 1942, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert">John P. Eckert</a>
                    and John W. Mauchly decided to build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. known 
                    as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, this  machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field
                    - Magnetic core memory and transistor - circuit elements. These technical discoveries quickly
                    found their way into computers. Such computer were mostly found in large computer centers operated 
                    by industry, government and privite laboratories.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    in the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest posible computer with the greatest capacity 
                    reached a turning point with the stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access
                    time, and total capacity in the vicinity of <span style="background-color: violet">100,000,000 words</span>.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced programmable mini computers supplied
                    with software packages in the 1970's. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction to 
                    personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough 
                    to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer</a> and radio shack 
                    introduced very successful PC's in the mid 1970's.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    By the late 1980's, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handlig 32 bits 
                    of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Computer networking, e-mail and the internet, and electronic publishing are just a few of the
                    applications that have grown in recent years. computers continue to decrease in price, offering
                    the promise that soon, "computers will reside in most homes, offices and."
